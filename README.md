# 🔮 Scry

### Everything finds filenames. **Scry finds meaning.**

Instant, whole‑disk **semantic** file search that runs **100% offline**.
Type what you *mean* — not the exact words — and find the file. Your files never leave your machine.

`全盘语义搜索 · 秒懂你要找什么 · 纯本地、不联网、隐私零外泄`

**Windows · 100+ languages · CPU or GPU · no cloud, no account, no telemetry**

## Search your files by what they *mean*

You remember *what a file was about*. You don't remember its name, or which of five drives it's on, or whether you wrote "invoice" or "发票" or "billing". Keyword search fails you exactly there.

**Scry searches by meaning.** At its core is a **purpose‑built multilingual semantic model** — a compact **118‑million‑parameter embedding network** that understands *what text means* across **100+ languages**, **not** a bloated multi‑gigabyte local LLM bolted onto a search box. It **re‑ranks whole‑disk candidates with that model** in milliseconds, and — when you want the very best quality — it **builds a complete deep semantic index of the folders you choose**, embedding every passage so it can match your *idea* against files that share **zero words** with your query — **even in a different language** (search 中文, find English files, and vice versa).

A real semantic engine, not a keyword matcher with a marketing label — and it's **209 MB, lightweight, and 100% on your machine.**

> It's the search **Everything** should have grown into: same instant, whole‑disk reflex — but it understands you.

## By the numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **~8 ms** to semantically search **100,000 files** | comfortably interactive; the model is tiny, not an LLM |
| 🌐 **~0.1 s** whole‑disk semantic results | **zero pre‑indexing** — rides the OS content index |
| 🪶 **118M params · 235 MB** multilingual model | vs the **4–8 GB** local LLMs other "AI search" tools ship |
| 🌍 **100+ languages · cross‑language** | search 中文 → find English files: measured **1/10 → 10/10** vs an English‑only model |
| 🔁 **~35 s** to index 100k files, **~0.1 s** to re‑scan | incremental diff measured **235× faster** than a full scan |
| 🎯 matches paraphrases with **zero shared words** | exact FAISS + BM25 hybrid, fp16 — half the RAM/disk |
| 🔒 **0 bytes** leave your machine | fully offline · binds `127.0.0.1` · no account, no telemetry |
| 📄 **txt · md · pdf · docx** · no Docker, single `.exe` | bilingual UI, one‑click 中/EN toggle |

<sub>Speeds measured on a modern GPU (embedding) + FAISS; CPU stays well under the 100 ms interactive bar.</sub>

## Three ways to search, one box

| Mode | What it does | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| 🌐 **Whole‑disk Semantic** | Search the *content* of every file on the machine by meaning. Rides the Windows Search content index, then re‑ranks the hits with a neural model. | **None.** Open and go. |
| ⚡ **Filename** | Instant whole‑disk filename search, the way you already know it. | None. |
| 🎯 **Deep Semantic (Control Mode)** | Point it at folders (or a whole drive) and it builds its *own* deep index — the highest quality, catches paraphrases with **zero word overlap**. First scan is full; after that it only touches what changed, and keeps itself up to date in the background. | One click per folder. |

Plus: **bilingual UI (中文 / English, one‑click toggle)**, keyboard‑driven (`Enter` to search, `↑/↓` to move, `Enter` to open), live‑highlighted snippets that show *why* a file matched, and a portable build that runs on any Windows PC with **no Python install**.

## It learns *you* — on your machine

The more you use Scry, the better it fits you: the **files and folders you actually open float toward the top** for similar searches, weighted toward your recent habits. It's a gentle re‑rank — a fresh query is **never** hijacked, and it **never buries the more relevant result**. And it's personalization with nothing to give up: it learns **only from your own clicks, on your own disk, and never trains the model or sends anything anywhere.** Toggle it off or hit **Forget me** whenever you like.

## The privacy stance (the whole point)

- **Fully local.** The embedding model is bundled. Unplug the network and everything still works.
- **Binds `127.0.0.1` only.** Nothing is served to your LAN, let alone the internet.
- **No accounts, no telemetry, no "anonymous usage stats."** There is no server to call.
- Your index and settings live in `~/.localsearch_index` on your own disk.

## Quick start

**Run from source**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m localsearch.app          # opens http://127.0.0.1:8731 in your browser
```

or just double‑click **`run.bat`** (Windows).

**Portable build (no Python needed)** — package it into a single self‑contained folder with a bundled CPU model, then double‑click the `.exe`. Any Windows machine, fully offline. See [`localsearch/README.md`](localsearch/README.md) for the packaging recipe.

## How it works

```

   Whole‑disk              Filename                    Deep Semantic

    content index)          MFT filename)               your chosen folders)
        │                                                    │
        └──────────────►  neural re‑rank · Scry semantic model  ◄─┘
                              │
                     ranked files + the exact matching sentence, highlighted
```

- **Scry's semantic model:** a compact **118M‑param multilingual embedding network** (`multilingual-e5-small`, 384‑dim, **100+ languages**), purpose‑built to represent *meaning* — not a text‑generating LLM. Runs on CPU, no GPU required, and **never trains on your files**.
- **Retrieval:** exact FAISS (fp16 scalar‑quantized — half the RAM/disk, still exhaustive) fused with a BM25 lexical arm; CJK‑aware chunking + bigram tokenizer so Chinese documents are fully searchable.
- **Instant mode:** queries the OS content index via the `Search.CollatorDSO` provider, then embeds and re‑ranks the candidates — global content search with **zero pre‑indexing**.
- **Robust by design:** crash‑durable index writes (fsync + generation‑stamped, torn saves detected and quarantined), save‑on‑exit, live progress and search *during* indexing, and a single‑thread watcher that survives bulk file copies.

Scry is **multilingual** — one model covering 100+ languages, so you can search in one language and find files written in another (Chinese and English are both first‑class). Cross‑language retrieval is strong but not magic: a query can occasionally lose to a topically‑adjacent same‑language file. The promise isn't to beat a datacenter on a benchmark — it's cloud‑grade *convenience* with **zero** privacy cost.
