## Search your files by what they *mean*

You remember *what a file was about*. You don't remember its name, or which of five drives it's on, or whether you wrote "invoice" or "发票" or "billing". Keyword search fails you exactly there.

**Scry searches by meaning.** At its core is a **purpose‑built multilingual semantic model** — a compact **118‑million‑parameter embedding network** that understands *what text means* across **100+ languages**, **not** a bloated multi‑gigabyte local LLM bolted onto a search box. It **re‑ranks whole‑disk candidates with that model** in milliseconds, and — when you want the very best quality — it **builds a complete deep semantic index of the folders you choose**, embedding every passage so it can match your *idea* against files that share **zero words** with your query — **even in a different language** (search 中文, find English files, and vice versa).

A real semantic engine, not a keyword matcher with a marketing label — and its model is **235 MB, lightweight, and 100% on your machine.**

> It's the search **Everything** should have grown into: same instant, whole‑disk reflex — but it understands you.

## By the numbers

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚡ **~8 ms** to semantically search **100,000 files** | comfortably interactive; the model is tiny, not an LLM |
| 🌐 **~0.1 s** whole‑disk semantic results | **zero pre‑indexing** — rides the OS content index |
| 🪶 **118M params · 235 MB** multilingual model | vs the **4–8 GB** local LLMs other "AI search" tools ship |
| 🌍 **100+ languages · cross‑language** | search 中文 → find English files: measured **1/10 → 10/10** vs an English‑only model |
| 🔁 **~35 s** to index 100k files, **~0.1 s** to re‑scan | incremental diff measured **235× faster** than a full scan |
| 🎯 matches paraphrases with **zero shared words** | exact FAISS + BM25 hybrid, fp16 — half the RAM/disk |
| 🔒 **0 bytes** leave your machine | fully offline · binds `127.0.0.1` · no account, no telemetry |
| 📄 **10 formats** (txt·md·pdf·docx·xlsx·pptx·csv·html·rtf) · no Docker | single `.exe` · optional add‑on packs (DLC) |
| 🖼️ **Reads images too** — opt‑in OCR | screenshots / scans / photos searchable **by meaning** · Windows built‑in engine · **no model download** |

<sub>Speeds measured on a modern GPU (embedding) + FAISS; CPU stays well under the 100 ms interactive bar.</sub>

## Three ways to search, one box

| Mode | What it does | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| 🌐 **Whole‑disk Semantic** | Search the *content* of every file on the machine by meaning. Rides the Windows Search content index, then re‑ranks the hits with a neural model. | **None.** Open and go. |
| ⚡ **Filename** | Instant whole‑disk filename search, the way you already know it. | None. |
| 🎯 **Deep Semantic (Control Mode)** | Point it at folders (or a whole drive) and it builds its *own* deep index — the highest quality, catches paraphrases with **zero word overlap**. First scan is full; after that it only touches what changed, and keeps itself up to date in the background. | One click per folder. |

> **New here? Pick the right mode for your first try.** *Whole‑disk Semantic* is instant and needs zero setup, but it draws its candidates from the Windows index — so a **pure paraphrase or cross‑language query with no shared words** (exactly the "wow" demo) can come up empty there. For that, use **Deep Semantic**: add the folder once, let it index, and it matches *meaning* even when nothing overlaps. Rule of thumb — **Whole‑disk = broad & instant; Deep = deepest meaning.**

Plus: **bilingual UI (中文 / English, one‑click toggle)**, keyboard‑driven (`Enter` to search, `↑/↓` to move, `Enter` to open), live‑highlighted snippets that show *why* a file matched, and a portable build that runs on any Windows PC with **no Python install**.

**Optional add‑on packs (DLC).** The base stays tiny and 100% offline; heavier extras (starting with a larger multilingual model) download **only when you click**, from this repo's releases, SHA‑256‑verified — see **Add‑ons** in the app.

**Read text inside images (opt‑in OCR).** Flip on OCR in Control mode and Scry reads the text in your **screenshots, scans, and photos** with the **Windows built‑in OCR engine** — so a screenshotted receipt or a scanned contract becomes searchable **by meaning**, in whatever languages your Windows has OCR packs for (English + 中文 out of the box on most PCs). It downloads **no model** (Windows provides the engine and language data), stays **100% offline**, adds only ~4 MB to the app, and is **off by default** — turn it on and rescan. It's for *finding*, not perfect transcription: stylized or low‑res text can come out noisy, but semantic search shrugs that off.

## It learns *you* — on your machine

The more you use Scry, the better it fits you: the **files and folders you actually open float toward the top** for similar searches, weighted toward your recent habits. It's a gentle re‑rank — a fresh query is **never** hijacked, and it **never buries the more relevant result**. And it's personalization with nothing to give up: it learns **only from your own clicks, on your own disk, and never trains the model or sends anything anywhere.** Toggle it off or hit **Forget me** whenever you like.

## The privacy stance (the whole point)

- **Read‑only.** Scry only ever *reads* your files to index them — it never modifies, moves, renames, or deletes them. Your originals are untouched.
- **Zero outbound connections.** The base app never talks to the network: it binds `127.0.0.1` only (not even your LAN), bundles the model, and has no server to call — no accounts, no telemetry, no "anonymous usage stats." Unplug the network and everything still works. The **only** time Scry reaches the internet is if *you* click to download an optional add‑on pack, from this repo's GitHub Releases, SHA‑256‑verified. (Image OCR uses a local Windows API — it doesn't go online either.)
- **Fully local storage.** Your index and settings live in `~/.localsearch_index` on your own disk; delete that folder to wipe everything.
- **Light footprint.** CPU‑only (no GPU required); the bundled model is ~235 MB, and a 100k‑file deep index is ~154 MB on disk. Whole‑disk Semantic and Filename modes keep no index at all.

## Get it (no Python needed)

**[⬇ Download the latest release](https://github.com/xxx12e/scry/releases/latest)**, unzip anywhere, and double‑click **`本地语义搜索器.exe`** (or **`Run 运行.bat`**). A console window opens — keep it open; your browser opens the search page in a few seconds. That's it: any Windows 10/11 PC, fully offline, nothing to install.

<a id="is-it-safe-to-run"></a>
**Is it safe to run?** Yes, and here's how to check rather than take my word for it:

- It's an **unsigned** build, so Windows SmartScreen may say *"Windows protected your PC."* Click **More info → Run anyway**.
- **Antivirus false positives are expected.** This is an *unsigned, PyInstaller‑packaged* app, and the PyInstaller bootloader is a byte pattern that some heuristic/ML antivirus engines flag on sight — regardless of what the code does. A VirusTotal scan will likely show **a handful of ~70 engines** flagging it (usually minor ones, rarely Microsoft Defender). That's normal for legit Python apps built this way and is **not** evidence of malware. Your real assurances: the whole thing is **open source — read it, or build the `.exe` yourself**; the **SHA‑256 above**; and its **read‑only, offline** behavior. Want more certainty? Run it in **Windows Sandbox**.
- Verify the download is exactly the file I published — the SHA‑256 of `Scry-v1.4-win64-portable.zip` is:

```
967e132346c158eaeea8e07871184a39795e73c3d4e7e083a9521c5b9ee21162
```
```powershell
Get-FileHash Scry-v1.4-win64-portable.zip -Algorithm SHA256   # should match the line above
```

- It **only reads** your files and **never phones home** — see [The privacy stance](#the-privacy-stance-the-whole-point) below.

**Run from source (developers)**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m localsearch.app          # opens http://127.0.0.1:8731 in your browser
```

or double‑click **`run.bat`** (Windows). Packaging recipe: [`localsearch/README.md`](localsearch/README.md).

- **Scry's semantic model:** a compact **118M‑param multilingual embedding network** (`multilingual-e5-small`, 384‑dim, **100+ languages**), purpose‑built to represent *meaning* — not a text‑generating LLM. Runs on CPU, no GPU required, and **never trains on your files**.
- **Retrieval:** exact FAISS (fp16 scalar‑quantized — half the RAM/disk, still exhaustive) fused with a BM25 lexical arm; CJK‑aware chunking + bigram tokenizer so Chinese documents are fully searchable.
- **Instant mode:** queries the OS content index via the `Search.CollatorDSO` provider, then embeds and re‑ranks the candidates — global content search with **zero pre‑indexing**.
- **Robust by design:** crash‑durable index writes (fsync + generation‑stamped, torn saves detected and quarantined), save‑on‑exit, live progress and search *during* indexing, and a single‑thread watcher that survives bulk file copies.

Scry is **multilingual** — one model covering 100+ languages, so you can search in one language and find files written in another (Chinese and English are both first‑class). Cross‑language retrieval is strong but not magic: a query can occasionally lose to a topically‑adjacent same‑language file. The promise isn't to beat a datacenter on a benchmark — it's cloud‑grade *convenience* with **zero** privacy cost.
